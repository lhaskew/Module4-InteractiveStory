# Overview

This software is an interactive story where users make choices that change the outcome. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show text, handle clicks, and display different choices.

The purpose is to show how JavaScript can make a website interactive, as well as implementing multiple languages together in one project. It demonstrates how to change content and respond to user actions.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
